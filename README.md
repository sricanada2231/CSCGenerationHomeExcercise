# CSCGenerationHomeExcercise
Home excercise for QA position


I was not able to commit all the files related to this project due to some access issue so I uploaded the py file directly and commited the changes. You can copy the "gitHubRepositoryModule.py" file into your projects where selenium is already imported and can execute.

I have committed the screen recording file also for the scripts execution.

Below is my console out put after my excution results:
